# Problem Statement 

Many people who love fishing find it hard to plan their trips because they have to use lots of different apps 
and websites. They look at maps to find places to fish, check the weather on different apps, and even use special 
tools to see the phases of the moon. This takes a lot of time and makes things complicated. We need a simple solution 
that puts all this information in one place. My idea is to create a website that gives fishermen a score to show how 
good fishing will be in their area, along with the latest weather and moon phase information. This will make planning 
fishing trips easier and more fun.
